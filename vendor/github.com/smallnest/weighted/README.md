Package **weighted** implements the smooth weighted round-robin balancing algorithm. This algorithm is implemented in Nginx:
https://github.com/phusion/nginx/commit/27e94984486058d73157038f7950a0a36ecc6e35.


Algorithm is as follows: on each peer selection we increase current_weight
of each eligible peer by its weight, select peer with greatest current_weight
and reduce its current_weight by total number of weight points distributed
among peers.

In case of { 5, 1, 1 } weights this gives the following sequence of
current_weight's: (a, a, b, a, c, a, a)

This is an example to use it:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func ExampleW1_Next() {
	w := &W1{}
	w.Add("a", 5)
	w.Add("b", 2)
	w.Add("c", 3)

	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		fmt.Printf("%s ", w.Next())
	}
}
```

And this lib has provides another weighted round robin algorithm. This algorithm is used in [LVS](http://kb.linuxvirtualserver.org/wiki/Weighted_Round-Robin_Scheduling).
It has better performance but it is not so more smooth than the first algorithm, so you can select one algorithm according to your case. It is used like the first:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func ExampleW2_Next() {
	w := &W2{}
	w.Add("a", 5)
	w.Add("b", 2)
	w.Add("c", 3)

	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		fmt.Printf("%s ", w.Next())
	}
}
```
